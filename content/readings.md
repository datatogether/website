Data Together's reading group is an ongoing conversation on themes relevant to data stewardship.

**[Access the current semester's reading group on our Github.](https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether)**

### How it works

We organize our reading group by "semesters" of about six once-a-month conversations over video call, where we meet to discuss our curated reading selections.

### How to participate

**Anyone is welcome to join!** It's also okay to drop in for just one session in a semester.

What we ask:

* Do the readings
* Listen more than you speak. In particular, notice how many people are on the call (n) and try to speak no more than 1/nth of the time.
* Adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/datatogether/datatogether/blob/master/CONDUCT.md)

See the [Join]({{< ref join>}}) page for more information!
