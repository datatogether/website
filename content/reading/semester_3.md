What is the role of an individual in a system where we hold civic roles both in political and in digital contexts? What are the implications of one’s polity not aligning with one’s national or governmental state?

## Sessions

### Algorithmic Racism & Environmental Data Justice
**March 17**

How do choices in technology design and implementation reflect and impact broader social structures?  Let's explore, starting with readings from environmental data justice and studies of algorithmic racism.

### Content Moderation and Consent
**April 7**

This topic covers factors that impact the content that we see. How do platforms balance freedom of expression versus consent to avoid offensive content, navigate algorithmic versus human moderation and curation, or incentivize different types of interaction? What are downstream effects of these choices?

**Readings:**
* Bijan Stephen for The Verge: "[Something Awful's Founder Thinks Youtube Sucks at Moderation](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18744264/something-awful-youtube-moderation-rich-kyanka-lgbtq)" (2019) - strategies for moderation from Something Awful's founder
* Casey Newton for The Verge: "[Bodies in Seats](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa)" (2019) - around outsourced content moderation & its impacts on the humans who have to view & judge the content. Would recommend:
  * From the beginning to "But for the first time, three former moderators for Facebook in North America agreed to break their nondisclosure agreements and discuss working conditions at the site on the record."
  * NOT RECOMMENDED: the middle of the article for this group– it's good reporting but needs a content warning for graphic descriptions (and the intro gets the points across)
* Jussi Passanen: "[Human centred design considered harmful](https://www.jussipasanen.com/human-centred-design-considered-harmful)" – how good design principles applied to business sense can be harmful for humans, especially in the context of a livable planet
* **Choose one of the following** (their lengths vary):
  * Mark Scott for Politico EU: "[Why Banning Political Ads on Social Media Misses the Point](https://www.politico.eu/article/facebook-twitter-google-political-ad-ban/)" (2019) - argues that beginning to moderate content for advertising is the beginning of social media companies taking ownership/responsibility over user content generally
  * Niam Yaraghi for Brookings: "[Twitter's Ban on Political Advertisements Hurts Our Democracy](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/01/08/twitters-ban-on-political-advertisements-hurts-our-democracy/)" (2020) - discusses the unequal impact of the ban on more vs less-well funded political groups and pushes for more detailed transparency measures
  * Kate Conger for the New York Times: "[Twitter Will Ban All Political Ads, C.E.O. Jack Dorsey Says](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/technology/twitter-political-ads-ban.html)" (2019) – contrasted with the Facebook hands-off approach and Google's selective approach
* **Choose one of the following** (their lengths vary):
  * Clint Pumphrey for HowStuffWorks: "[How Do Advertisers Show Me Custom Ads?](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/advertiser-custom-ads.htm)" (2012) – cookies and retargeting, notice tone
  * Cade Metz for the New York Times: "[How Facebook's Ad System Works](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/technology/how-facebook-ads-work.html)" (2017) – targeting factors that Facebook uses for ads, the inception of ads into a content stream, some treatment of the Russia issue
  * Cole Nemeth for Sprout Social: "[How the Twitter Algorithm Works in 2020](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/twitter-algorithm/)" (2020) before "How to turn off the Twitter algorithm" – a really short one just highlighting the factors involved
  * Will Oremus for Slate: "[Twitter's New Order](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/cover_story/2017/03/twitter_s_timeline_algorithm_and_its_effect_on_us_explained.html)" (2017) – much more in depth (not just how but why and future directions) but pretty long
  * Josh Constine for TechCrunch: "[How Facebook News Feed Works](https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/06/ultimate-guide-to-the-news-feed/)" (2016) before "An Updated List Of News Feed Algorithm Changes"

*Optional bonus readings*
* Naomi Wu's experience with media manipulation & being "content moderated" off of several funding platforms she had used to make a living: [part 1](https://medium.com/@therealsexycyborg/shenzhen-tech-girl-naomi-wu-my-experience-with-sarah-jeong-jason-koebler-and-vice-magazine-3f4a32fda9b5) and [part 2](https://medium.com/@therealsexycyborg/shenzhen-tech-girl-naomi-wu-part-2-over-the-wall-and-into-the-fire-5e8efc5c1509) – this is very interesting and topical but too long to include in the required reading
* [Flame Warriors](https://www.politicsforum.org/flame-warriors/), if you'd like a lighter take, is a tongue-in-cheek characterization of the various types of people moderators encounter
* The end of the Casey Newton "[Bodies in Seats](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa)" article, from "Last week, I visited the Tampa site with a photographer." to the end, interesting additional perspective re trying to figure out how this stuff *should* be done

### Data Monopolies
