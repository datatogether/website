[This presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Gx8vSqrWZ7X-3SCgITXqQdinZQeXIAA7ITqL25SsPN8/edit?usp=sharing) explores what happens when files are shared over peer-to-peer networks. Using Dat and IPFS, two of the leading peer-to-peer protocols, the slides give a beginner-friendly overview of how users connect to the network, add data, and access data - as well as what's happening behind the scenes.
